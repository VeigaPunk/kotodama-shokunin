CONTROL-MET: packet-one-word-page-variant (SESSIONS-only probe; S600)

# MutEvidenceA3 — revision-7 EVIDENCE residual control

## Scope and axes

Reviewed `evidenced`, `page_texts`, and their SUPPORT call site at lane commit `1cd9db7cdc83fd41f5d04cd620af879555442f19`, counter sha256 `45ce3ef43d11686a41a36ab752541a99f561a665cfd209633ceeb7cf88137d59`. Read claims.json revision_note_6 and revision_note_7 first. This is a pre-data control, not a support verdict, admission, integration, or canonical judgment.

Axes: (1) distinguishing actual page reading from packet-only evidence, (2) retaining honest positives and quotation-format invariance, (3) row/page identity and pinned-text hash integrity, (4) separating frozen provenance from the explicitly authorized SESSIONS probe, and (5) bounded reproducibility. The affected claim axis is depth only indirectly: these controls concern the validity of the reading witness, not the scholarship of the entry.

**Result:** a ten-word line generated from a packet alone counted for S600 in all three assigned seats and the complete probe reached PASS. Shared-site boilerplate also counted for two pages per fixture. Properly paired internal quotation marks caused genuine thirteen-word page evidence to fail; removing only that punctuation restored PASS. A truly absent word, the teaches cell, a foreign-only page span, and a wrong text_sha256 were rejected. All 17 frozen fixtures failed solely at SUPPORT because all 24 authentic session files were absent; no real-provenance bypass was demonstrated.

## Method and authority boundaries

Private `git clone --no-hardlinks` checked out the specified commit. The lane counter and claim build were not edited. All fixture files and generated dependencies stayed under `/fast/scratch/hyaku/kotodama-r60a3/MutEvidenceA3/`; the sole lane write is this report. No data seat, actual support packet/key, support history, or other runtime was invoked. New **dry-run** packets/key were generated once with the frozen build-packets.py and the supplied frozen planted rows; their random assignment was retained for every case. The two wave-1 fixture builders were copied into this sandbox and read for patterns, not executed against their original paths. Only results exercised here are cited.

Every synthetic fixture contains the exact 24-seat roster, planted NOT-SUPPORTED and real SUPPORTED labels, a byte-bound packet in session_init, one last own-report write matching the report, and curl-shaped calls for each block URL with cwd `/tmp/<Seat>`. The curl calls are explicitly synthetic and **were not executed**. They furnish no fetched response to the packet-only generator. Remaining rows use detector-positive oracle evidence from the correct pinned pages; this is calibration, not a claim that any human or live seat did scholarly work. Each attack replaces every occurrence (three seats) of its target row; boilerplate replaces all occurrences of both relevant site rows. Thus a third honest vote cannot mask a failing attack.

Both executable counters were run in the private clone using `timeout 600 python3 -B reports/round-60/accept-d[ -probe].py` with a 45-second outer subprocess bound; the runner itself had a 54-second process bound. PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 was set throughout. Full stdout and exit codes are preserved below without trimming. The probe changes only SESSIONS; its complete diff appears below. Counter code, parser, evidence thresholds, and source/page fixtures are otherwise unchanged except for the expressly labeled bad-hash fixture.

The standard honest-shaped positive (`honest-all-47`) reached **probe PASS, exit 0**, with 47 correct pages, 141 real SUPPORTED occurrences, 48 planted NOT-SUPPORTED occurrences, and 24 qualified seats. Straight and curly outer delimiters also reached probe PASS. The paired-internal-quote honest variants did **not** reach probe PASS; that is the separately demonstrated false-void defect.

## Strongest counterexample: packet-only repeated first word

Frozen locations: accept-d.py:143–169, 598–600, 633–648; reopen-quote.py:74–75,135–141. `evidenced` tests whether the **entire** normalized quoted span is absent from the packet; it does not require ten words of undisclosed content. The locator also concatenates title/navigation and body text.

The S600 packet quote starts `Amulets are items worn to protect their wearer by ...`. The page text at S600.txt:52,58 has a title `Amulets`, then the first sentence `Amulets are items worn to protect their wearer by ...`. This line passes:

```text
VERDICT P07 SUPPORTED — "amulets amulets are items worn to protect their wearer by"
```

The ten-word packet block span was `quote amulets are items worn to protect their wearer by`; only the first word changes. More importantly, **every word needed to generate the passing span is already in the quote**: prepend its first word to its first nine words. The independent executable `packet-only-repeated-word.py` receives one dry-run packet on stdin, imports no file/network libraries, reads no page/key, and generated the matching candidate anew for each of SupportQ60/P07, SupportT60/P06, SupportW60/P01. Their own-write EVIDENCE calls all returned true; full probe SUPPORT had unsupported=[] and all 24 seats qualified. Full counter PASS is therefore compatible with three unread S600 verdicts. This is not an all-47-rows packet-only exploit or a generalization claim; skipping the target page is sufficient to defeat that row's claimed reading proof.

No-page-reader impact: **YES, demonstrated for this row in the allowed probe.** An actual seat could perform a fetch-to-/dev/null and compute the evidence from its packet without inspecting the response; the transfer from this synthetic probe to an authentic seat is [INFERENCE], not an observed real-session bypass.

## Other accepted negatives

1. **Half quote / half new, S600:** `"by their religious associations a religious equivalent to armour in"`. The first five words are packet-quoted; the final five are the page's continuation. All three target seats count, full probe PASS. This demonstrates that the ten-word threshold does not mean ten unseen words. **No-page reader: NOT independently demonstrated by this fixture**: the harness selected the five continuation words from the pinned page. Guessing/recombining such a continuation would count [INFERENCE], but unlike the repeated-first-word case no packet-only constructor was established here.
2. **Gutenberg boilerplate / foreign-page reuse:** `"this ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in"` counted for S604 and S637, all six occurrences; full probe PASS. It appears on both pinned Gutenberg pages, not their packet blocks. **No-target-page reader: YES at the EVIDENCE boundary**: a known license prefix or the other page supplies the same witness without reading the target article. Evidence is for all **2/2 pinned** Gutenberg pages; no unsupported claim about every page on the entire live site is made.
3. **Met boilerplate / foreign-page reuse:** `"the met collection open access data and public domain images"` counted for S601 and S649, all six occurrences; full probe PASS. It appears on both pinned Met pages. **No-target-page reader: YES at the EVIDENCE boundary**: the site navigation text learned from another page is reusable. Again the observation is **2/2 pinned** pages, not an untested site-wide census.

The boilerplate fixtures demonstrate cross-row text reuse when the text also happens to locate in the target. A genuinely foreign-only span from S600, `"in ancient egypt any item of jewellery is likely to have some"`, supplied for S650 was correctly rejected: probe FAIL, S650:good=0. The implementation does check the target sid's text; the weakness is non-specific shared text, not unconditional lookup of the wrong page.

**Contract distinction:** all four accepted-negative fixtures satisfy revision 7's literal whole-span condition. They are wrong for its claimed proof-of-reading purpose, not counter/predicate disagreements. Strengthening that purpose requires an explicit pre-data predicate/evidence-policy change through the canonical authority, not silently relabeling existing matches. No judgment or admission is made here.

## Honest evidence wrongly rejected by quote parsing

S601.txt:859 contains this exact thirteen-word span:

```text
Its ancient Egyptian name, wedjat, means "the one that is sound." In Egyptian
```

Both of these properly paired outer/inner forms failed:

```text
VERDICT P04 SUPPORTED — “Its ancient Egyptian name, wedjat, means "the one that is sound." In Egyptian”
VERDICT P04 SUPPORTED — "Its ancient Egyptian name, wedjat, means “the one that is sound.” In Egyptian"
```

The whole normalized span locates in S601 and is absent from the packet. EVIDENCE_SPAN excludes **all** straight/curly double-quote characters regardless of which type opened the evidence. It splits the legitimate outer quotation into fragments of fewer than ten words. Three S601 occurrences therefore all fail; complete probe SUPPORT reports S601:good=0. Replacing only internal punctuation, with the same normalized thirteen words, gives:

```text
VERDICT P04 SUPPORTED — “its ancient egyptian name wedjat means the one that is sound in egyptian”
```

That fixture reaches full probe PASS. Plain straight-versus-curly **outer** quotes alone both work. An earlier truncated-inner-quote diagnostic also failed and is retained transparently in the receipts; the balanced-pair fixtures are the stronger counterexample.

No-page-reader impact: **NO**. This is an honest-reader retention/quotation-format false void, not a way to count without reading.

## Correctly rejected negatives and page_texts integrity

- Exact ten packet words, and the complete teaches cell: probe FAIL, S650:good=0.
- One packet word changed to `unverifiablemutationtoken`, which is absent from the page: probe FAIL, S650:good=0. No approximate/fuzzy matching was found.
- Nine genuinely page-derived words: probe FAIL, S650:good=0.
- A span only on another row's page: probe FAIL, S650:good=0, as above.
- **pages/manifest.json text_sha256 mismatch:** only S650's text_sha256 was replaced with 64 zeroes; text bytes and the original captures manifest were unchanged. `page_texts` omitted S650, SUPPORT printed pinned-pages=46 and S650:good=0, full probe FAIL. PINNED still PASS because that separate leg checks captures/manifest.json, not pages/manifest.json. Thus the new page hash check fails closed for this tested mismatch. The manifest was restored after each batch. The pre-manifest direct-function value in cases.json is not the bad-manifest result; the complete counter receipt is authoritative.

None of these correctly rejected negatives permits a no-page reader to count in the tested fixtures.

## Smallest safe correction, not applied

- **Fixable parsing defect:** recognize a paired outer delimiter while allowing the other quote style inside it; keep the current locator normalization. Preserve the paired and punctuation-normalized examples as equivalent positives. Do not “fix” this by requiring stricter byte equality, which would harm honest punctuation invariance.
- **Proof-of-reading defect requires declared semantics:** require an evidence witness comprising at least ten words of genuinely undisclosed, page-specific content, not a ten-word near-copy whose whole string is absent. A bounded design is to exclude page intervals already disclosed by packet quote/other verbatim fields and shared site/navigation/license intervals, then require an intact ten-word witness outside those intervals. Distinguish canonical-page identity when checking sharing. This needs explicit predicate approval and re-calibration of honest positives; it is not a drop-in regex tweak and no particular implementation has been validated here.
- Keep the tested text_sha256 fail-closed behavior and the independent provenance leg. Do not waive real provenance because a probe passes, and do not treat generic boilerplate or successful curl syntax as article-reading evidence.

These corrections separate axes instead of trading one for another: the delimiter fix should retain honest evidence without making packet-only evidence stronger; the novelty/specificity requirement must not be declared successful unless honest positives remain countable. The canonical judge, not this report, decides the admissibility of a changed evidence policy.

## Reproduction, bounds, and tools

Artifacts: prepare-evidence.py, run-evidence.py, cases.json, extra-cases.json, honest-spans.json, shared-site-spans.json, packet-only-repeated-word.py, sessions-only.diff, and outputs/<case>-{frozen,probe}.{stdout,stderr,json}; outputs/<case>-checks.json records the exact attacked own-write lines. All are under the named private sandbox. The generated dry-run packets/key stay in that sandbox clone. Run the listed case names with `timeout 54 env PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 python3 -B run-evidence.py <case...>` there, in short sequential batches because each fixture rewrites the same private support area.

No host tooling install/update and no pacman transaction occurred. The frozen counter materialized its required **pypdf 5.4.0** dependency through **uv 0.13.0 `uv run --with pypdf==5.4.0`**, for PINNED's PDF extraction; UV_CACHE_DIR and TMPDIR were restricted to this sandbox. That transient dependency materialization is the only install-like action. The sandbox allocated size was 185,475,072 bytes at the final exercised fixture, below 200 MB. An initial post-receipt bookkeeping assertion followed uv interpreter symlinks into /usr and over-counted their external targets; it was corrected to lstat. Both initial counter runs had already completed and their original receipts/stdout are retained; no counter result was discarded or rerun to hide that harness error.

Probe sha256: `366dc07f0e456a2a797ee681efd80351ac09ce93a366c4a4fb8d288773ab901a`. Packet-only generator sha256: `a2ac99f97f1815bca53c452c124ce668738b14a6e69696af19bc74c21aa34611`.
